# Next-Sessional Binding

> On 2023-03-28: ❌ [2023-05-22][The GUI control needs to be interwoven with the recursive harvester; cannot use mode detector]
> - The 'get_auto_risat_detil()' and 'experiment_6()' functions need to be repaired,
>   and that's all!
> - Everything else seems to work out just fine.
>   Except the two functions above, the script file remains consistent and working

> On 2023-05-22: ✅ [2023-05-29][All clear and all done]
> In the function 'test_harvest_r_1_dana':
> - Obtain the XPATH of each of the 24 components, and try to paint the worksheet
> - DO-OR-DELEGATE: Get all 'anggota' data rows
> - DO-OR-DELEGATE: Integrate with the GUI's control element and then
>   convert from 'test_' into 'run_'

> On 2023-05-29: 🔁 [2023-06-05][Some are cleared]
> Do the following:
> - Fix 'Rumpun Ilmu' column data not showing every information from the Risat site ✅
> Then attempt to generalize 'run_harvest_r_1_dana' into the following functions:
> - run_harvest_c_1_arsip ✅ (successful testing)
> - run_harvest_c_1_dana ✅
> - run_harvest_r_1_arsip 🔁

> On 2023-06-05:
> Do the following:
> - Finish up the 'test_harvest_r_1_arsip' function
> Then generalize 'run_harvest_r_1_arsip' into the following function:
> - run_harvest_c_1_arsip
