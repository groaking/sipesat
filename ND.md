# Not-Doing List

> On 2023-03-28: ❌ [2023-05-22][The GUI control needs to be interwoven with the recursive harvester; cannot use mode detector]
> - The 'get_auto_risat_detil()' and 'experiment_6()' functions need to be repaired,
>   and that's all!
> - Everything else seems to work out just fine.
>   Except the two functions above, the script file remains consistent and working

> On 2023-05-22:
> In the function 'test_harvest_r_1_dana':
> - Obtain the XPATH of each of the 24 components, and try to paint the worksheet
> - DO-OR-DELEGATE: Get all 'anggota' data rows
> - DO-OR-DELEGATE: Integrate with the GUI's control element and then
>   convert from 'test_' into 'run_'
